// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF num is divisible by 2
THEN Even
ELSE Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

PRINT "ENTER 5 numbers"
numbers=(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5)
SORT ASC
SUM=(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)
AVERAGE=(SUM/5)
MIN=(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5) ORDER ASC; LIMIT 1
MAX=(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5) ORDER DEC; LIMIT 1
PRINT('The Average of these numbers is', AVERAGE)
PRINT(MIN, 'is the smallest number')
PRINT(MAX, 'is the largest number')
